	Version: 202300909
	Target: Arm Cortex A9 on the DE10-Nano development board

	A basic "Hello, World!" bare-metal C program for the DE10-Nano
	development board.  It is for the SoC (aka HPS) part of the FPGA so it
	should work on other Cyclone V SoC-FPGA dev boards, e.g.: DE1-SoC, DE-10
	Standard, Arrow SoCKit, etc.

	Uses the Intel/Altera HWLIB bare-metal library for many of the low level
	hardware access, and these are identified by their naming prefix "alt_" or
	"ALT_".
